        Cholet, a combination of the vernacular Spanish cholo and the Swiss French chalet, 
        is a curious term that straddles nations and languages. 
        The word is a neologism, either pejorative or complimentary depending on its context, 
        used to capture the design aesthetic of twenty-first-century 
        Bolivian architect Freddy Mamani and his visually arresting buildings.

      <p>
        Whereas in the media outside of Bolivia, Mamani’s constructions often circulate as reproducible, 
        uninhabited products for the imagined projections of viewers, 
        in Bolivia they are a result of a long process of material accumulation 
        that only recently coalesced into the dynamic city that is El Alto.

       The tension between the process of constructing and the product that is the cholet 
        is emblematic of the contradictions inherent in the urban Indigenous Aymara of El Alto, 
        as they abide by, and manipulate, global capitalism’s imperatives.

        This evolving elite class, composed mainly of former mining and peasant migrants to the city, 
        are both disruptive agents and appropriated objects of transnational capital.” 
        They participate in global markets and use them to their own ends, 
        while they are objectified and exploited by the same.”
