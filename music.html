  Most people know “Lambada” by Kaoma, but few know its source: Los Kjarkas’ original “Llorando Se Fue.” Drawn from a traditional Andean melody set to Afro-Bolivian Saya rhythms, this gentler folk song was later at the heart of a lawsuit when Kaoma used it without authorization—and Los Kjarkas prevailed.

  Los Kjarkas formed in the early 1970s performing Argentine zambas, but as Nueva Canción rose they shifted to Quechua and Aymara folk, adding panpipes (siku), quena flutes, string lutes, and tree-trunk drums. Their unique blend of Indigenous wind instruments and folk-pop arrangements has kept their music timeless.

  During Bolivia’s 2019 coup, far-right threats silenced many Indigenous artists, yet Los Kjarkas openly supported Evo Morales. Blacklisted and unable to perform for a year, they finally returned to the stage alongside Morales. Their resilience under political pressure symbolizes the fight for Indigenous identity and artistic freedom.

  Los Kjarkas’ music transcends politics, offering a sonic journey high above sea level. Their heartfelt vocals and authentic Andean instrumentation—melding communal singing with intimate crooning—provide a refreshing counterpoint to mass-produced pop. Listening to them feels like breathing mountain air: revitalizing, uplifting, and deeply rooted in tradition.
