        Centuries ago, Spanish colonizers forced their Bolivian servants 
        to wear the puffy skirts that have come to symbolize the country's "cholitas," or indigenous women. 
        Today, one local designer  plans to export cholita fashion blossoming skirts, bowler hats and woven shawls to Madrid, Paris and beyond. 
        Fresh off her first show at NY Fashion Week, Eliana Paco, a 34-year-old indigenous Aymara designer, is ready to bring her take on a once-stigmatized style to the world.

     "Cholitas" -- a diminutive of "chola," a sometimes derogatory word for a woman from Bolivia's indigenous majority -- were once seen here as a silent underclass of maids and manual laborers. But in a changing Bolivia currently governed by its first indigenous president, Evo Morales, Paco said she sees the traditional women's costume as a symbol of "identity and pride." She has already made her mark on the local fashion scene, where TV presenters and cabinet ministers now regularly sport the indigenous look, updated and embellished.

      She took a big step in September in New York, where she made headlines with her latest collection, 
        "Pachamama" (Mother Earth, in the Quechua language). "It's the first time a chola women's suit has 
        arrived on the runway. There were 12 international models wearing our designs," she said. Paco's exuberant dresses, 
        vibrant shawls and gravity-defying bowlers captured industry insiders' attention.

        Paco said she sees an international market for her designs.
        "I think it's possible European women could use the shawls or hats for everyday wear," 
        said the designer smiling. Her colorful "aguayo" shawls 
        are hand-woven with naturally dyed alpaca or vicuna wool. The best ones take a team of 
        three people two weeks to finish. The below-the-knee skirts have three or four layers, 
        each using up to six meters of fabric. They can weigh up to 10 kilos (22 pounds).
