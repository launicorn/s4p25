       Roberto Mamani Mamani's bold, eye-catching paintings of brilliantly colored mountains, 
        the Earth Mother Pachamama and indigenous Bolivians have made him one of Bolivia's best-known artists. 
        Mamani Mamani lives in La Paz, a city in Bolivia's high-altitude western plains and the center of the country's government. 
        He calls himself Quechua Indian by birth and Aymara Indian by blood, because he grew up in an Aymara family in the Quechua-dominated valleys of Bolivia.

       The valleys and gently rolling mountainous landscape of his childhood feature in Mamani Mamani's art, 
        as does the indigenous religion and worldview his grandmother taught him. The Earth Mother Pachamama, 
        shown as a rounded and strong indigenous woman, is a common presence in his work. 
        By combining images from Spanish colonial art into this Andean landscape, 
        Mamani Mamani produces a world that is distinctly Bolivian.

        Mamani Mamani spoke with us in his gallery in La Paz.
        ROBERTO MAMANI MAMANI: 
        I did my first drawings with charcoal from the fire where my mother cooked. I had a happy childhood, because it was a childhood with the Earth. 
        My family later moved to La Paz, and here I learned from my grandmother.
        She taught me the rituals and the offerings to the Pachamama—offerings and respect to the Mother Earth, air, fire, 
        and everything that lives.

        So that's not a master's degree at a university, it's a form of life and a relationship with it.
        Then I won a couple of prizes when I was young, which opened a lot of doors for me, museums and galleries. 
        From USAID I received an invitation to the United States and that was the first time I met our indigenous brother 
        from the United States. I was in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and it was an important meeting for me—an exchange of ideas 
        on what it is to be indigenous.That was 15 or 20 years ago. In addition to the Andean communities that are very spiritual and 
        full of ritual, part of my focus has also been on the Spanish conquest.
I say if the Spanish brought their gods and put them over ours gods, why can't we put ours over theirs?
