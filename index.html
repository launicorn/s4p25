      <h4>About this site</h4>
      <p>
        The new Aymara bourgeoisie are, in a way, practicing
        indigenous futurism through architecture. They are
        acknowledging the melting pot of influences from
        which they came — imperialist and otherwise — while
        designing and building for the Bolivia they want. Bolivia
        is in a constant state of reconciliation between its
        colonial past and the desire for a global future. Sculptor
        Ramiro Sirpa explains how he makes things by hand
        from metal, resin, fiberglass, and lights, calling them
        “one hundred percent Bolivian.”
        
        I also set up a few links... click on "Top 10"
        and you'll go to the start of a top 10 list... then there's a link back
        to this page. Can copy and paste any of these tags or delete them and
        replace with your own content.
